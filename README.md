# Titanic-Machine_Learning_Disaster-kaggle

It's a *Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Start here! Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics* from *<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Kaggle</a>* 

So, If you think it's easy for beigner not at all but still good to start with it first. If you notice tag line "Start here! Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with *ML basics*". You will get famillier to basics of Machine Learning.

Concept will be same where as the code is avilable in Python and definately scope of improvement. I tried to comment and mantain code very well.

I have divided this problem three parts<br>
1. Pre-processing<br>
2. Applying algo and Hypertunning<br>
3. Validation and Prediction
